•	Lifetime value calculation:
      LTV  = margin * transaction revenue * DET
      Where, margin = profit the firm makes per sale 
      Transaction revenue = how much a customer is expected to spend during each transaction 
      DET = Discounted expected transactions, that is the total number of transaction a customer is expected to make in his lifetime
•	For computation purpose, since DET cannot be calculated and margin is not available, the formula is modified as:
      LTV = transaction(t) * transaction revenue
      Where, transaction (t) is the expected transaction in period t
      Transaction revenue definition is same as above
•	Number of transaction in time t can be predicted using Pareto NBD model
•	Transaction revenue can be predicted using Gamma-Gamma distribution model or Linear regression model
